# PyNA

This pipeline utilizes Genome Analysis Toolkit's best practices workflow for single 
nucleotide polymorphism and insertion/deletions as the basic framework to improve upon. 
The main contribution of this pipeline includes fine search via variant allele frequency,
biotype, annotations, impact, transcript length, and mapping quality associated with each 
variant to increase the overall sensitivity and specificity. Along with variant detection, 
this pipeline also supports the identification of variants demonstrating either allele-specific 
expression or loss of heterozygosity properties.

## Pipeline
![alt text](https://github.com/lcwong0928/PyNA/blob/master/workflow.png)

## Features

* Identification of high impact mutations in RNA sequence data.
* Support for allele-specific expression or loss of heterozygosity property detection.
* Pipelines Raw DNA and RNA sequence to Annotated VCF format.
* Detects consequences in resulting peptide in single nucleotide polymorphism.
* Query by name, location, overlapping regions in  GRCh38/hg38.

### Installation


```
git clone https://github.com/lcwong0928/PyNA.git PyNA
```


## Usage

Query by name about gene of interest based on GRCh38/hg38.

```
pyna name [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-f FEATURE] gene [genes ...]

# [-o OUTPUT] saves as txt file at given directory
# [-f FEATURE] CDS, exon, five_prime_utr, gene, Selenocysteine,
                  start_codon, stop_codon, three_prime_utr, transcript
```


Query by location based on GRCh38/hg38.

```
pyna location [-h] [-o OUTPUT] coord [coord ...]

# coord formated as chr:coord, i.e. chr2:208236227 (IDH1)
# [-o OUTPUT] saves as txt file at given directory
```


Query by overlapping regions based on GRCh38/hg38.

```
pyna overlap [-h] [-o OUTPUT] coord [coord ...]

# coord formated as chr:coord-coord, i.e. chr2:208236227-208266074 (IDH1)
# [-o OUTPUT] saves as txt file at given directory
```



### Results

Will be documented shortly.
